# CleaningDataProject
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

High level activities performed on the data sets.

1. Down loaded the data into the R working directory, unzip the files.
2. Created one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
3. Extracted required data sets into R data matrices.
4. Assigned descriptive activity names to the names and activities in the data set
5. Merged the training and the test data sets to create one data set.
6. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
7. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. Uploaded the extracted file into project assignement page.
